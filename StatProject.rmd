# Statistical Inference Course Project
Part I - A Simulation Exercise
## Overview :
In this project we will be investigating the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theoram. The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n,lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean and standard deviation of the exponential distribution is 1/lambda. We will set lambda = 0.2 for all the simulations. We will investigate the distribution of 40 iid exponentials and do a thousand simulations.
